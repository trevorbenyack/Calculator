# HTML Calculator app
Web based calculator app

- Style and behavior modeled after the macOS calculator app.
- Output runs off the screen if it gets to large, and that will be something I try to address at a later time
- This was hard lol
- jQuery rocks. Thanks Mike!
- It's all in one file for easier portability
- There's not really anything new here except the jQuery stuff but I only read the couple first pages on w3c so it's not too deep
- I left my testing output in it so you could see what happens as you press individual buttons
- Feel free to comment, always open to feedback!
